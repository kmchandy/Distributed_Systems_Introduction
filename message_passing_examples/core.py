core.py
This module contains the Block, Network, Agent and SimpleAgent classes, and the functions that
form the foundation of a message-passing framework for building distributed
applications. We refer to an instance of Block, Network, Agent, and SimpleAgent as block, network,
agent and simple_agent respectively.

Block and Stream
----------------
A block is specified by a list of input ports, a list of output ports, and
a function run.

A stream -- a sequence of messages -- enters a block on each of its input
ports, and a stream leaves a block on each of its output ports. The lists
of input and output ports can be empty. We refer to input ports and output
ports as inports and outports, respectively.

A block starts execution when its run function is called.

A block may have a name and a description. The block name and description can be
put into a block repository which can be searched to find blocks that fit a
specification.  We use JSON for block descriptions and repository structure.
We can use AI to help build systems by having a block search the repository to
find other blocks with which it can collaborate to build applications.


Network
-------
A network is an instance of Block. A network consists of a set of interconnected
blocks. We refer to blocks within a network as components of the network.

Ports of the network are connected to ports of components. Output ports of compnents
are connected to input ports of components. Connections between ports are specified
by a directed graph in which a block is a component.

Each block in a network has a unique name and each port of a block has a unique name.
When we refer to block 'X' and port 'p' we mean the block with name 'X' and the port
with name 'p' respectively.

connections: Connecting ports
-----------------------------------------
Ports are connected in the following way:

1. Connect inport 'p' of the network to inport 'w' of component 'X'.
        [inport 'p'of network ]   --->   [inport 'w' of component 'X']

A stream to inport 'p' of the network is the stream to inport 'w' of component 'X'.
A message sent to inport 'p' of the network is received through inport 'w' of
component 'X'.

2. Connect outport 'w' of component 'X' to outport 'p' of the network.
    [output port 'w' of component 'X']   --->    [output port 'p'of network ]

A stream from outport 'p' of the network is the stream from outport 'w' of component 'X'.
A message sent through outport 'w' of component 'X' is sent through outport 'p' of the network.

3. Connect an inport of a component to arbitrarily many inports of the network
and to arbitrarily many outports of components.
                                              ___________________________________
    [inport 'p'of network ]             --->  |                                 |
    [inport 'q' of network ]            --->  | input port 'r' of component 'Z' |
    [outport 'w' of component 'X']      --->  |                                 |
    [outport 'v' of component 'Y']      --->  |_________________________________|

Multiple streams merge to form the input stream into an inport of a component.
Messages sent to inports 'p' and 'q' of the network and messages sent by component 'X'
through its outport 'w', and messages sent by component 'Y' through its outport 'v' are
received by inport 'r' of component 'Z'.

4. An outport of a component is connected exactly once. Connect outport 'w' of a
component 'X' to:
    a single outport of the network:
    [outport 'w' of component 'X']      --->     [outport 'v' of network]
    or to a single inport of a component.
    [outport 'w' of component 'X']   --->    [inport 'v' of component 'Y']
    Messages sent through outport 'w' of component 'X' are received by component 'Y'
    along inport 'v'.

A network executes its run function by executing run functions on all its component
blocks.



Agent
-----
Agent inherits from Block and has two additional functions.
    (1) for an agent X and outport 'p' of X, and a message msg
              X.send(msg, 'p')
     sends msg through outport 'p'.
    (2) for an agent X and inport 'p' of X,
              msg = X.recv('p')
     If there is a message at inport 'p' then the message is removed from
     the port and assigned to variable msg of X. If there is no message at
     'p' then X waits until a message arrives at 'p' and then assigns the
     message to msg.


SimpleAgent
-----------
SimpleAgent inherits from Agent. A simple_agent is specified by two functions
init_fn and handle_msg. A simple_agent has a single input queue. You do
not specify the run function of a simple agent. The run function consists of
executing init_fn followed by execution of a loop which waits for messages on
its single input port and then calls handle_msg to process the message. The
loop terminates when a '__STOP__' message is received.
